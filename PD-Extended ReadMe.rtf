Since PD-Extended has been discontinued, here are screenshots of some of my work coding in pd-extended. These patches show the evolution of different ring modulators and samplers that I created. The ring modulators play a tone above and below the carrier input frequency at the distance of the frequency of the modulator wave. You can change the modulator wave with the sliders, as well as the volume. The simple ring mod uses input, while the extended ring mod uses midi input. The samplers allow users to play and alter the speed and volume of audio samples. The extended sampler also allows the user to visualize the sin waves of the audio sample in use.}
